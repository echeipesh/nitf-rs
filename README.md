A rust NITF file interface

Current project goals are
- Finish implementing version 2.1 reading, maybe writing
- Expand into a SICD file reader 
- Provide `Python` bindings 

This started as a personal project to learn the language better, and I work on 
it as I have time to. 

If you have questions, would like to contribute, or would like to request 
something be added, I made a discord server [here](https://discord.gg/Kg7NwN4XgS)
which you can join and ask/request stuff.
